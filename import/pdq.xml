A surgical procedure to remove a visible lesion on the skin in several steps. First, a thin layer of cancerous tissue is removed.

A myeloid stem cell becomes a red blood cell, a platelet, or a myeloblast, which then becomes a granulocyte (the types of granulocytes are eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils). A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast and then becomes a B lymphocyte, T lymphocyte, or natural killer cell. A B lymphocyte may become a plasma cell.</alt-text><related-terms><term-id>glossary_CDR0000411381</term-id><term-id>glossary_CDR0000045793</term-id><term-id>glossary_CDR0000411383</term-id><term-id>glossary_CDR0000046230</term-id><term-id>glossary_CDR0000411384</term-id><term-id>glossary_CDR0000411386</term-id><term-id>glossary_CDR0000633941</term-id><term-id>glossary_CDR0000044795</term-id><term-id>glossary_CDR0000046231</term-id></related-terms><vol_id>7177</vol_id><vol_title>Hematopoietic Tree Plasma Cell</vol_title><vol_type>Color, Medical Illustration</vol_type><vol_author>Terese Winslow (Illustrator)</vol_author><vol_reuse>This image is copyright protected.
