85266,NHGRI-85266,http://www.genome.gov/dmd/img.cfm?node=Photos/Graphics&id=85266,Apoptosis,"Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death. It is used during early development to eliminate unwanted cells; for example, those between the fingers of a developing hand. In adults, apoptosis is used to rid the body of cells that have been damaged beyond repair. Apoptosis also plays a role in preventing cancer. If apoptosis is for some reason prevented, it can lead to uncontrolled cell division and the subsequent development of a tumor.","Darryl Leja, NHGRI",National Institutes of Health,"NIH, National Human Genome Institute (Darryl Leja)",http://www.genome.gov/,1625 x 1500
85273,NHGRI-85273,http://www.genome.gov/dmd/img.cfm?node=Photos/Graphics&id=85273,Cancer,"Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth. Cancer begins when a single cell mutates, resulting in a breakdown of the normal regulatory controls that keep cell division in check. These mutations can be inherited, caused by errors in DNA replication, or result from exposure to harmful chemicals. A cancerous tumor can spread to other parts of the body and, if left untreated, be fatal.","Darryl Leja, NHGRI",National Institutes of Health,"NIH, National Human Genome Institute (Darryl Leja)",http://www.genome.gov/,2165 x 1221
